= The Trac Wiki Engine =
[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac has a built-in wiki engine, used for text and documentation throughout the system. WikiFormatting is used in [wiki:TitleIndex wiki pages], [wiki:TracTickets tickets] and [wiki:TracChangeset check-in log messages].  This allows for formatted text and hyperlinks in and between all Trac modules.

Editing wiki text is easy, using any web browser and a simple [WikiFormatting formatting system], rather than more complex markup languages like HTML.  The reasoning behind its design is that HTML, with its large collection of nestable tags, is too complicated to allow fast-paced editing, and distracts from the actual content of the pages. Note though that Trac also supports [wiki:WikiHtml HTML], [wiki:WikiRestructuredText reStructuredText] and [http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ Textile] as alternative markup formats.

The main goal of the wiki is to make editing text easier and ''encourage'' people to contribute and annotate text content for a project.

The wiki itself does not enforce any structure, but rather resembles a stack of empty sheets of paper, where you can organize information and documentation as you see fit, and later reorganize if necessary.
