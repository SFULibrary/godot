= Wiki Page Names =

Wiki page names commonly use the CamelCase convention. Within wiki text, any word in CamelCase automatically becomes a hyperlink to the wiki page with that name.

CamelCase page names must follow these rules:

 1. The name must consist of '''alphabetic characters only'''. No digits, spaces, punctuation, or underscores are allowed.
 2. A name must have at least two capital letters.
 3. The first character must be capitalized.
 4. Every capital letter must be followed by one or more lower-case letters. 
 5. The use of slash ( / ) is permitted in page names (possibly representing a hierarchy).

If you want to create a wiki page that doesn't follow CamelCase rules you can use the following syntax:
{{{
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"] that page name embeds space characters
 * or simply: ["WikiPageName"]s (!MoinMoin's internal free links style)
}}}

This will be rendered as:
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"] that page name embeds space characters
 * or simply ["WikiPageName"] (!MoinMoin's internal free links style)

Finally, and as exemplified in the line above, one can also append an anchor to a Wiki page name, in order to link to a specific section within that page. The anchor can easily be seen by hovering the mouse over a section heading, then clicking on the [[html(&para;)]] sign that appears at its end. The anchor is usually generated automatically, but it's also possible to specify it explicitely, see WikiFormatting#using-explicit-id-in-heading
