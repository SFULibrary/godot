= Trac Support =

Like in most [http://www.opensource.org/ open source projects], "free" Trac support is available primarily through the community itself, mainly through the [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MailingList mailing list] and the project wiki.

There is also an [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/IrcChannel IRC channel], where people might be able to help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.

Before you start a new support query, make sure you've done the appropriate searching:
 * in the project's [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracFaq FAQ]
 * in past messages to the Trac [http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.trac.general?set_user_css=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edgewall.com%2Fcss%2Fgmane.css&do_set_user_css=t Mailing List]
 * in the Trac ticket system, using either a [http://trac.edgewall.org/search?q=&ticket=on&wiki=on full search] or a [http://trac.edgewall.org/query?summary=~&keywords=~" ticket query].
