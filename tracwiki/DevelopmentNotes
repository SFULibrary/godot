== Development Notes ==

Miscellaneous notes related to godot development.

=== Things to try if godot is not working ===

1. Check values in both GODOT/lib/GODOT/BasicConfig.pm and GODOTConfig/lib/GODOTConfig/BasicConfig.pm.  Values to pay attention to include the location of the global templates, site templates and the '''configuration cache'''. This becomes an issue particularly when you are running development and production copies of godot.

2. If you are overriding a method that returns the current value of the object when no parameters are passed, then remember to include this logic in your overriding method. 

=== Notes from migrating configuration database from stalefish server to lib-godot server in December 2010 ===

{{{
root on stalefish
stop httpd_godot_v2
disable config cgi -- include 'unavailable' message

root on lib-godot
su postgres

##
## The '--encoding=UNICODE' does not work for the stalefish dump as the database is encoded with SQL_ASCII and conversion is not possible.
##

pg_dump --host=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx --data-only --encoding=UNICODE  GODOT_config > /tmp/GODOT_config.stalefish.<date>.dump
start httpd_godot_v2 but keep config cgi disabled

move dump file to ~kristina/godot_misc/migration
change ownership to kristina
exit from postgres and root

cd ~kristina/godot_misc/migration

change all instances of ownership 'tholbroo' to 'godot';  

change all carriage returns to '\r' using '~kristina/godot_misc/migration/carriage_return.pl';
check for data that is not UTF-8 encoded using '~kristina/encoding/check_for_valid_encode_utf8.pl'

pggc
\i empty_GODOT_config
check for any errors
\q

comment out all sql in empty_GODOT_config

su root
su godot
cd /home/kristina/godot_misc/migration
psql GODOTConfig < GODOT_config.stalefish.<date>.dump.no_cr

run comparisons of tables on lib-godot and stalefish:

psql -d GODOTConfig -U godot
\o accounts.lib-godot
select id,key,name,password,email,phone,administrator,active from accounts order by id;
\o site_config.lib-godot
select id,site,config_group,field,value from site_config order by id;
\o
\q

psql -h xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -d GODOT_config -U tholbroo
\o accounts.stalefish
select id,key,name,password,email,phone,administrator,active from accounts order by id;
\o site_config.stalefish
select id,site,config_group,field,value from site_config order by id;
\o
\q

diff accounts.lib-godot accounts.stalefish
diff site_config.lib-godot site_config.stalefish

run optimization commands:

stop httpd and godot_para_server first or vacuum will hang
su postgres
psql GODOTConfig
vacuum full;
analyze;

}}}
