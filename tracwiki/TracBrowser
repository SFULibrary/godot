= The Trac Repository Browser =
[[TracGuideToc]]

The Trac repository browser can be used to browse directories 
and specific revisions of files stored in the repository of the configured
version control system.

Directory entries are displayed in a list with sortable columns. The list 
entries can be sorted by ''name'', ''size'' or ''age'' by clicking on the column
headers. The sort order can be reversed by clicking on a given column
header again.

The browser can be used to navigate through the directory structure 
by clicking on the directory names. Clicking on a file name will show
the contents of the file. Clicking on the revision number of a file or
directory will take you to the TracRevisionLog for that file.
Note that there's also a ''Revision Log'' navigation link that will do
the same for the path currently being examined.

It's also possible to browse directories or files as they were in history,
at any given repository revision. The default behavior is to display the
latest revision but another revision number can easily be selected using
the ''View revision'' input field at the top of the page.
