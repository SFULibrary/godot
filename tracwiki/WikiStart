This is the '''GODOT development wiki'''.  The main reSearcher site is at http://researcher.sfu.ca.

Code repository log is at http://lib-code.lib.sfu.ca/projects/godot/log/trunk.  

There is also a ticket database ([[report:9 open]] and [[http://lib-code.lib.sfu.ca/projects/godot/query?status=closed&group=milestone&order=priority closed]]) although it is currently somewhat out of date and needs a good review and clean up.
