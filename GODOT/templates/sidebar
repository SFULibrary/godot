[%#

If you define a sidebar, you should modify the following CSS attributes to
ensure the content does not overlap the sidebar.

div#sidebar { width: ...; }
div#content { margin-left: ...;}

The div#content margin-left should be slightly larger than the div#sidebar
width. As usual, you should try to use relative sizes such as "5em" rather
than pixel specific sizes unless your sidebar is image driven and does not
change size with font size changes.
