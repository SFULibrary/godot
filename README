Installing GODOT

    Please see 'http://researcher.sfu.ca | DOCUMENTS | GODOT Administration Guide'
    for installation instructions.


Changes

    2.0.3 Fixed problem related to using Class::Accessor and 'location' as a field name.  
          Assume this was related to the fact that location is also a subroutine name.

    2.0.2 Performance improvements.  Changed site profile cache to use object store of 
          GODOTConfig::Cache objects implemented as files in a cache directory.  Removed 
          unnecessary string conversions in GODOT::CatalogueHoldings::Record and 
          GODOT::CatalogueHoldings::BibCirc logic.

    This is not a complete list.  Citation parsers were written by others at SFU and at other 
    COPPUL libraries.  I need to review some of our old documentation as well look at some of 
    the comments in the parser modules in order to complete the list.  If you know of others
    that should be added to this list, please let me know.
